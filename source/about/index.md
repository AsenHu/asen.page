Welcome to my blog! I'm a student with a passion for technology and open-source
software. My primary device is a laptop running Arch Linux with the Plasma
desktop environment. I have a strong preference for Debian and Arch systems for
server deployments, and I use YAAP on my mobile phone, focusing on free and
open-source software.

I enjoy programming in TypeScript and Python, and Iâ€™m skilled at navigating
various Linux distributions, especially Debian-based systems like Debian and
Ubuntu, as well as Arch. My experience spans a wide range of deployments, from
traditional server setups to cloud-native solutions, whether it's a simple
application or a complex distributed system.

One of my proudest projects is self-hosting a Matrix server at
[nekos.chat](https://nekos.chat), where I explore decentralized communication.

You can reach me via email at [i@asen.page](mailto:i@asen.page) or connect with
me on Matrix at `@asen:nekos.chat`.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find something inspiring!
